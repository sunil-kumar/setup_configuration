       composer create-project drupal/recommended-project project-folder-name
       composer create-project drupal/recommended-project:9.3.6 project-folder-name (for specific version of drupal).

       composer require mglaman/drupal-check --dev (for site specific)
       composer global require mglaman/drupal-check (for global)

       vendor/bin/drupal-check -d web/modules/custom/yhub_vy_dashboard/ (check the dashboard module deprecations)
       vendor/bin/drupal-check -a web/modules/custom/yhub_vy_dashboard/ (check the dashboard module analysis)
